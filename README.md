## **Food Delivery Time Prediction Project**


### **Introduction**

This project aims to predict the delivery time of food orders based on various factors. The goal is to provide customers with accurate delivery time estimates, improving their overall experience, and helping restaurants better manage their resources and operations.


### **Data**

The dataset used in this project contains information about food orders from multiple restaurants, including delivery time, restaurant ID, order ID, delivery distance, and various other factors that may affect the delivery time.


### **Methodology**


The project will use machine learning algorithms to predict delivery times based on the available data. The data will be split into training and testing sets, and several models will be trained and evaluated to determine the best-performing model.
Tools and Technologies.

This project will use the Python programming language, along with various libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Jupyter Notebook will be used as the development environment.


### **Steps Involved**


**Data cleaning and preprocessing**: The raw data will be cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and outliers, and to prepare the data for modeling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The data will be analyzed to identify patterns and trends, and to gain insights into the factors that affect delivery times.


**Feature Engineering**: New features will be created based on the existing data to improve the performance of the machine learning models.


**Model Training and Evaluation**: A LSTM netwrok is trained on this data and it is avaluated aganist mean squared error (MSE). It was monitored on Validation Loss.


### **Conclusion**
This project aims to provide accurate delivery time estimates for food orders using machine learning algorithms. By improving delivery time estimates, customers can have a better experience, and restaurants can optimize their operations and resources.
